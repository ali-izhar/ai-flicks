        <h1 class="fw-bold text-center pb-4">Guide to Prompt Design for Text-to-Image Models</h1>
        <hr class="bg-light my-4">
        <div class="my-5">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Template and Tokenization</h3>
            <p class="lead">A prompt usually follows the following template:</p>
            <p class="text-muted fst-italic">[Art form] of [subject] by [artist(s)], [detail 1], ..., [detail n]</p>
            
            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">1. Subject</h5>
            <p class="lead">The most important part of a prompt is the subject. What do you want to see? While this might be the most straightforward, it is also the most difficult regarding the amount of detail you want to provide.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/guide/cat.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mt-3" style="width: 250px;" alt="a cat wearing sunglasses">
                <figcaption class="text-muted text-center">Prompt: "a cat wearing sunglasses"</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">2. Plurals</h5>
            <p class="lead">Vague plural words like "cats" leave a lot of room for interpretation. Did you mean two cats or 13 cats? Therefore, when you want multiple subjects, use plural nouns with specific numbers.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/guide/cats.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mt-3" style="width: 250px;" alt="two cats wearing sunglasses">
                <figcaption class="text-muted text-center">Prompt: "two cats wearing sunglasses"</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">3. Weights</h5>
            <p class="lead">If you want to give a specific subject a heavier weight, there are various ways to do so.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Order: </strong>Tokens near the front of a prompt are weighted more heavily than the tokens in the back of a prompt.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repeating the subject by phrasing it differently can impact its weighting. I have also seen prompts repeating the subject in different languages or using emojis.</li>
                <li><strong>Parameters: </strong>You can suffix any part of a prompt with ::weight to give it a weight (e.g. ::0.5).</li>
                <li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Prompts containing negative words like "not", "but", "except", and "without" are difficult for the text-to-image model to interpret. Therefore, it is best to avoid them.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">4. Negative Prompting</h5>
            <p class="lead">Negative prompting is a technique that can be used to give the model a better idea of what you want to see. It is a way to tell the model what you do not want to see. For example, if you want to see a bowl of fruit but do not want to see apples, you can use the following prompt: "a bowl of fruit" but include "apples" in the negative prompt.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/guide/bowl.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mt-3" style="width: 250px;" alt="a cat wearing sunglasses and a dog">
                <figcaption class="text-muted text-center">Prompt: "a bowl of fruit"; Negative Prompt: "apples"</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">5. Art Form</h5>
            <p class="lead">The art form is the medium in which the subject is presented. It can be a painting, a photograph, a sculpture, or a drawing. It can also be a specific style like impressionism, cubism, or surrealism.</p>

            <p class="lead">The artist(s) is the creator(s) of the subject. It can be a specific artist like Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, or Leonardo da Vinci. It can also be a specific art movement like impressionism, cubism, or surrealism.</p>

            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">7. Combining Features</h5>
            <p class="lead">You can combine multiple features to create more specific prompts. For example, you can combine a subject with an art form, an artist, or both.</p>
            <figure>

            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">8. Adjectives and Quality Boosters</h5>
            <p class="lead">You can use adjectives to describe the subject. You can also use quality boosters to make the subject more vivid and detailed.</p>

                <li><strong>framing</strong> (close up, landscape, portrait, wide shot, etc.)</li>
